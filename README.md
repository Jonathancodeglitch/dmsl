# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

// todo
//add animation using gsap
// add courosel slide for the testimony section
// when the see more btn is clicked show the remaining text

//problem
//images not loading fast allowing the next section to job to the current section with screws with the animation
// my tween animation are loading imediatly

//the solution should be to set up tween when everything in the page has completely loaded
